                        <br>Somehow we gotta find a way
                        <br>No matter how many miles it take
                        <br>I know it feels so good right now
                        <br>But it all come fallin' down
                        <br>When the night, meet the light, turn to day
                        <br>Can't stop, then you won't stop
                        <br>I know just how that feel
                        <br>When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
                        <br>You've never seen it be so real
                        <br>It feels so good right now
                        <br>But it all come fallin' down

                        <br>[Verse 1]
                        <br>Feel it a little, feel it a lot
                        <br>I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
                        <br>Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
                        <br>Into some shit, I'm out of the box
                        <br>This the level I'm on, needin' it all right now or forever is gone
                        <br>Baby, the weather is strong, whether it's hot or cold
                        <br>I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
                        <br>Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
                        <br>Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
                        <br>And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
                        <br>All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
                        <br>We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
                        <br>It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size, yeah
                        <br>See the bigger picture when it's beneficial
                        <br>Lovin' how I fit you, blow the whistle when you run out of time, yeah
                        <br>Wakin' up, I open up my eyes
                        <br>Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
                        <br>A little closer, baby, don't be shy
                        <br>Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
                        <br>I guess it's that kinda day
                        <br>It's really all I'm tryna say
                        <br>We don't have a lot of time to waste

                        <br>All the lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
                        <br>I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
                        <br>I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
                        <br>Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
                        <br>I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
                        <br>And I don't know it all, but I do know this
                        <br>Before you know me, better know self
                        <br>I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
                        <br>I turn the hotel to a castle
                        <br>Livin' like a king for a grand
                        <br>I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
                        <br>Besides, even that castle made of sand
                        <br>Just might slip into the sea
                        <br>Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
                        <br>Maybe we inside the maze
                        <br>Somehow we gotta find a way, okay
