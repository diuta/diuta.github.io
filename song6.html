                                <br>Take it from the top
                                <br>If I start, I just can't stop
                                <br>All the patience that I've got
                                <br>It's not enough to save me
                                <br>It's a race against the clock
                                <br>But we don't wanna watch
                                <br>Keep running 'til we're lost
                                <br>You got me thinkin'

                                <br>I can feel your heart beatin' with mine
                                <br>Underneath the stars, lookin' for a sign
                                <br>Glowin' in the dark 'til the sun shines
                                <br>Made it pretty far on the first try
                                <br>Might've set the bar a little too high
                                <br>Started with a spark now we're on fire
