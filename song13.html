                            <br>Through thick and thin
                            <br>Good times and bad
                            <br>To stop you drinking the Kool-Aid
                            <br>And hold you when you're sad
                            <br>A shoulder to cry on
                            <br>A hoodie to wear
                            <br>Somebody that calls up
                            <br>Just to let you know they care
                            <br>

                            <br>We let the lines get blurry
                            <br>Now both of us are hurting

                            <br>You knew I wasn't ready
                            <br>I'm too unsteady
                            <br>Don't make me make the call
                            <br>This doesn't have to be the end
                            <br>You gave me an ultimatum
                            <br>You said verbatim
                            <br>"If you want me, take it all
                            <br>Or you'll never see my face again"
                            <br>Guess I'll never see your face again

                            <br>I crashed my Mercedes
                            <br>Somewhere near the coast
                            <br>I couldn't reach you
                            <br>When I needed you the most
                            <br>And that night I got roofied
                            <br>And passed out on the floor
                            <br>When I asked you to come home
                            <br>You said you'd rather dance alone
                            <br>
                            <br>[Pre-Chorus]

                            <br>I'm too unsteady
                            <br>Don't make me make the call
                            <br>This doesn't have to be the end
                            <br>You gave me an ultimatum
                            <br>You said verbatim

                            <br>[Outro]
                            <br>Baby, we finally reached the end
                            <br>'Cause we were never really friends
