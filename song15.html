                            <br>Just as you take my hand
                            <br>Just as you write my number down
                            <br>Just as the drinks arrive
                            <br>Just as they play your favourite song
                            <br>As your bad day disappears
                            <br>No longer wound up like a spring
                            <br>Before you've had too much
                            <br>Come back in focus again
                            <br>The walls are bending shape
                            <br>They've got a Cheshire cat grin
                            <br>All blurring into one
                            <br>This place is on a mission
                            <br>Before the night owl
                            <br>Before the animal noises
                            <br>Closed circuit cameras
                            <br>Before you're comatose
                            <br>
                            <br>[Verse 2]
                            <br>Before you run away from me
                            <br>Before you're lost between the notes
                            <br>The beat goes 'round and 'round
                            <br>The beat goes 'round and 'round
                            <br>I never really got there
                            <br>I just pretended that I had
                            <br>Words are blunt instruments
                            <br>Words are sawn-off shotguns
                            <br>Come on and let it out
                            <br>Come on and let it out
                            <br>Come on and let it out
                            <br>Come on and let it out
                            <br>Before you run away from me
                            <br>Before you're lost between the notes
                            <br>Just as you take the mic
                            <br>Just as you dance, dance, dance
                            <br>
                            <br>[Chorus]
                            <br>A jigsaw falling into place
                            <br>So there is nothing to explain
                            <br>You eye each other as you pass
                            <br>She looks back, and you look back
                            <br>Not just once, and not just twice
                            <br>Wish away your nightmare
                            <br>Wish away the nightmare
                            <br>You got the light, you can feel it on your back
                            <br>A light, you can feel it on your back
                            <br>Your jigsaw falling into place
                            </p>
