                [Intro: Frank Ocean] <br />Poolside convo about your summer last
                night, ooh yeah <br />About your summer last night <br />Ain't
                give you no play, mmm <br />Could I make you shive last night?
                <br />Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
                <br />Could we make it in? Do we have time?
                <br />
                <br />[Verse 1: Frank Ocean] <br />I'll be the boyfriend in your
                wet dreams tonight <br />Noses on a rail, little virgin wears
                the white <br />You cut your hair, but you used to live a
                blonded life <br />Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the
                same advice <br />And our time was right
                <br />
                <br />[Chorus: Austin Feinstein] <br />Keep a place for me, for
                me <br />I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing <br />It's
                nothing, it's nothing <br />Keep a place for me, for me
                <br />
                <br />[Verse 2: Frank Ocean] <br />Now and then, you miss it,
                sounds make you cry <br />Some nights, you dance with tears in
                your eyes <br />I came to visage 'cause you see me like a UFO
                <br />That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
                <br />And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
                <br />
                <br />[Chorus: Austin Feinstein & Yung Lean] <br />Keep a place
                for me, for me <br />I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
                <br />Keep a place for me <br />It's nothing, it's nothing
                <br />It's nothing, it's nothing
                <br />
                <br />[Bridge: Frank Ocean] <br />Sometimes you'll miss it
                <br />And the sound will make you cry <br />And some nights,
                you're dancing <br />With tears in your eyes
                <br />
                <br />[Outro: Frank Ocean] <br />I, I, I know you gotta leave,
                leave, leave <br />Take down some summertime <br />Give up, just
                tonight, 'night, 'night <br />I, I, I know you got someone
                comin' <br />You're spittin' game, know you got it <br />I, I, I
                know you gotta leave, leave, leave <br />Take down some
                summertime <br />Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night <br />I,
                I, I know you got someone comin' <br />You're spittin' game,
                know you got it (Yeah) <br />I, I, I know you gotta leave,
                leave, leave <br />Take down some summertime <br />Give up, just
                tonight, 'night, 'night <br />I, I, I know you got someone
                comin' <br />You're spittin' game, know you got it
