                            <br>The great protector
                            <br>Is that what I'm supposed to be?
                            <br>What if all this counts for nothing
                            <br>Everything I thought I'd be?
                            <br>What if by the time I realize
                            <br>It's too far behind to see?
                            <br>Seventy-mil projector
                            <br>I can show you everything, yeah
                            <br>And we're on our way to glory
                            <br>Where the show won't ever end
                            <br>And the encore lasts forever
                            <br>And it's time we're due to spend
                            <br>
                            <br>[Verse 2]
                            <br>Spending the years together
                            <br>Growing older every day (Every day)
                            <br>I feel at home when I'm around you
                            <br>And I'll gladly say again
                            <br>I hope the encore lasts forever
                            <br>Now there's time for us to spend
                            <br>And it's sublime with you, my friend
                            <br>This right here still feels like a honeymoon
                            <br>When you say my name, nothing's changed
                            <br>I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
                            <br>Am I meant to understand my faults?
                            <br>
                            <br>[Chorus]
                            <br>I don't think so
                            <br>I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
                            <br>Maybe you do
                            <br>And that's good for you
                            <br>Maybe in time
                            <br>Maybe one day
                            <br>I'll do the same
                            <br>(I'll do the same
                            <br>I'll do the same
                            <br>I'll do the same)
                            <br>
                            <br>[Bridge]
                            <br>I'll do the same as you
                            <br>I'll try and hold it up
                            <br>Soon I hope
                            <br>Or as soon as I'm old enough
                            <br>(Old enough to understand
                            <br>Old enough to understand)
                            <br>
                            <br>[Outro]
                            <br>Stay forever, you know more than anyone (Yeah, whoa)
                            <br>And it's you that knows my darkness
                            <br>And you know my bedroom needs
                            <br>You could blast me and my secrets
                            <br>But there's probably just no need
